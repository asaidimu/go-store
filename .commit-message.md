docs(site): overhaul documentation with VitePress

Refactor the project documentation system to use VitePress for improved structure, readability, and user experience.

Key changes include:
- Transitioned to a modern static site generator (VitePress) for the entire documentation.
- Rewrote and reorganized all content into task-based guides, advanced usage explanations (concurrency, memory management), and detailed API references.
- Integrated structured data (.response.json) for automated API documentation generation.
- Updated CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy the new documentation site to GitHub Pages.
- Enhanced troubleshooting, FAQ, and error handling sections for clarity.
