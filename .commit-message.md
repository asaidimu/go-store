feat(store): implement core in-memory document database

- Introduces the Store struct with complete CRUD operations (Insert, Get, Update, Delete).
- Adds field-based indexing (CreateIndex, Lookup, LookupRange, DropIndex) powered by B-trees for efficient querying.
- Implements robust concurrency safety using optimistic concurrency control, atomic pointers, and fine-grained locking.
- Provides a channel-based DocumentStream for efficient iteration over store contents.
- Integrates github.com/google/btree for indexing and github.com/google/uuid for document ID generation.
- Replaces previous placeholder code with the fully functional store logic and extensive test suite.
- Overhauls project documentation (README.md, docs/) to detail new features, architecture, and usage examples.
