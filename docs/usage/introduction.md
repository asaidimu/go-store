go-store is a lightweight, high-performance in-memory document database designed for applications requiring fast, concurrent access to schemaless data. It provides core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and advanced features like field-based indexing, range queries, and document streaming.

The store leverages Go's concurrency primitives (`sync.RWMutex`, `atomic.Pointer`) and `github.com/google/btree` for efficient, thread-safe operations. Documents are stored as flexible `map[string]any` types, and changes are managed via an optimistic concurrency control mechanism using versioned `DocumentSnapshot`s and reference counting, ensuring data consistency even under heavy concurrent loads.

Key considerations for `go-store` are its in-memory nature (data is not persisted to disk and will be lost upon application shutdown) and its focus on efficient concurrent access patterns, making it suitable for caching layers, temporary data storage, or embedded application-level databases where persistence is handled externally or not required.
