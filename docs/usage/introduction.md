This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to `go-store`, an efficient, in-memory, concurrent-safe document store with built-in indexing capabilities. Designed for high-performance applications requiring fast, concurrent access to schemaless data, `go-store` offers core CRUD operations, flexible document schemas, and advanced features like field-based indexing, range queries, and document streaming. It leverages Go's concurrency primitives for thread-safe operations, making it suitable for caching layers, temporary data storage, or embedded application-level databases where data persistence is managed externally or not required.
