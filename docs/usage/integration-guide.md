# Integration Guide

## Environment Requirements

Go runtime version 1.24.4 or higher. No specific compiler settings or platform constraints beyond standard Go development practices.

## Initialization Patterns

### Basic Store Initialization and Closure

The standard pattern for initializing a new store instance and ensuring its proper closure upon application exit.

```[DETECTED_LANGUAGE]
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	store "github.com/asaidimu/go-store"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new in-memory store instance
	s := store.NewStore()
	// Defer the Close() call to ensure resources are released when main exits
	defer s.Close()

	fmt.Println("Store is initialized and ready for operations.")

	// Your application logic here, interacting with 's'
}

```

## Common Integration Pitfalls

- **Issue**: Operations on a closed store
  - **Solution**: Once `s.Close()` is called, the store cannot be reused. Ensure `Close()` is called only when the store is no longer needed, typically at application shutdown.

- **Issue**: Data loss on application exit
  - **Solution**: `go-store` is an in-memory database and does not persist data to disk. For persistence, implement an external serialization/deserialization layer or use it as a caching mechanism.

- **Issue**: Attempting to create an index that already exists
  - **Solution**: The `CreateIndex` method will return `ErrIndexExists` if an index with the same name already exists. Handle this error or `DropIndex` the existing index first if redefinition is intended.

- **Issue**: Not handling errors from API calls
  - **Solution**: All operations that can fail return an `error`. Always check the error return value and handle specific `go-store` errors (e.g., `ErrDocumentNotFound`, `ErrIndexNotFound`) appropriately.

## Lifecycle Dependencies

`go-store`'s components are managed by the `Store` instance. `NewStore()` must be called first to initialize the core data structures and internal mechanisms. All operations (Insert, Update, Delete, Get, CreateIndex, DropIndex, Lookup, Stream) require an active `Store` instance. `Close()` should be called as the final step in the store's lifecycle to release resources and prevent memory leaks, making the `Store` instance unusable afterwards. There are no explicit initialization dependencies on external application frameworks, just the Go runtime.
